Hi! Welcome to my personal website!

This website serves as a personal repository for my educational progress and is openly shared for anyone interested in learning alongside me. Here, you'll find various resources, notes, and reflections on what I'm studying. 

Currently, I'm  sharpening my coding skills by coding on Leetcode every day. You can explore my detailed notes [here](https://yuyulyu.github.io/categories/leetcode/), where I document my progress, thought processes, and key learnings.
