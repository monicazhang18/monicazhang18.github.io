Hi! Welcome to my personal website!

This site is dedicated to documenting and sharing my learning journey. Here, you'll find various resources, notes, and reflections on what I'm studying. The primary purpose of this website is to serve as a personal repository for my educational pursuits. While the materials here are primarily for my own use, I warmly invite you to explore and benefit from them as well.
