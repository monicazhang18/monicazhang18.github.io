**Asymptotic efficiency of algorithm 渐进效率**
How the running time of an alhprithm increases with the size of the input in the limit, as the size of the input increases without bound.
An algorithm is asymptotically more efficient -> the best choice for all but very small inputs.

#Asymptotic notation 渐进记号
##O-Notation - upper bound 渐进上界
