## String-matching algorithm

A string-matching algorithm wants to find the starting index `m` in string `s` that matches the search word `w`.[^wiki] This process is foundational in text processing and computer science applications such as text editing and data retrieval.

**Example**
  - `s = "ABCABABCABDA"`
  - `w "ABCABD"`

### Brute force solution

The brute force approach employs a straightforward method using two pointers: one traverses the main string `s` and the other checks against the target word `w`. For each character in `s`, it compares the subsequent characters up to the length of `w`. If a mismatch occurs, the pointer in `s` moves to the next character, and the comparison begins anew.

However, this approach has a time complexity of `O(mn)`, where `m = len(s)` and `n = len(w)`. This method can become extremely inefficient, especially when mismatches consistently occur near the end of` w` and when `w` itself appears late in `s`. For example, consider `s = "000000000000000000001"` and `w = "00000001"`. In this scenario, nearly every attempt will process almost the entire length of `w` before encountering a mismatch, leading to significant redundancy in the search process.

### The advantage of KMP

The **<ins>Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)</ins>** algorithm enhances efficiency through the use of a **<ins>Prefix Table</ins>** (aka. **<ins>"Partial Match" Table</ins>**[^wiki]) `next`. This table allows the algorithm to skip over sections of `s` that have previously been matched against parts of `w`, avoiding re-evaluation of characters that will anyway match according to the prefix table.

## How KMP works

### Prefixes and Suffixes
  - **Prefix Table**:
    - This table is constructed from the search word `w` and records the length of the longest prefix which is also a suffix for the substring ending at each index `i` (inclusive).
    - **Prefix**:
      - A prefix of a string is any substring that <ins>starts at the beginning of the string</ins> and <ins>does not include the last character</ins> of the string. These are all possible leading segments of the string.
    - **Suffix**:
      - A suffix of a string is any substring that <ins>ends at the end of the string</ins> and <ins>does not include the first character</ins> of the string. These are all possible ending segments of the string[^dmsxl].

For each `next[i]` it record the longest prefix of `w` that matches a suffix ending just before `w[i]`. Instead of restarting the search from the next character in s, a prefix table `next` allows us to jump to `w[next[i]]`, effectively bypassing the redundant re-checking of characters that are guaranteed to match based on previous comparisons. 

### Preprocessing: Create a prefix table

This preprocessing step involves the following three main stages:
  1. Initialization
  2. Handling Mismatches
  3. Handling Matches

#### <ins>1. Initialization</ins>

First, create an array `next` of the same length as the pattern `w` and initialize all entries to `0`.

```python
get_next(w, next):
	next[0] = 0
```
After that, initialize pointers `i = 1`, `j = 0` such that:
  - `i` is the end of suffix and <ins> the next element in `next` to be updated </ins>.
  - `j` is the end of prefix that is match with the suffix, and it also represent <ins>the length of the longest matched prefix and suffix</ins>.

#### <ins>2. Handling Mismatches</ins>

When the last element of the prefix `s[j]` mismatches with the end of the suffix `w[i]`, we update the pointer `j` to find the next possible prefix length, and therefore move the `j` 1 step forward and look at the value of `next` in that position.

```python
while j > 0 and w[i] != w[j]:
        j = next[j - 1]
```

There can be scenarios where even after falling back to a previous prefix length (`j = next[j-1]`), the new position of `j` still does not match the current character `w[i]`. Therefore, the `while` loop (`while j > 0 and w[i] != w[j]`) ensures that the algorithm continuously adjusts the length of the prefix being considered (`j`) until it either finds a matching prefix that can also match `w[i]` or exhausts all possible prefixes.

#### <ins>3. Handling Matches</ins>

When a match is found between `w[i]` and `w[j]` (`w[i] == w[j]`), it indicates that a prefix of length `j` ending at `j-1` can be extended by one character (`w[i]`). 

```python
if w[i] == w[j]:
        j += 1
```

#### The complete code

```python
get_next(w, next):
	next[0] = 0
  for i in range(1, len(w)):
      while j > 0 and w[i] != w[j]:
          j = next[j - 1]
      if w[i] == w[j]:
          j += 1
      next[i] = j
```
