## String-matching algorithm

A string-matching algorithm wants to find the starting index `m` in string `s` that matches the search word `w`.[^wiki] This process is foundational in text processing and computer science applications such as text editing and data retrieval.

**Example**
  - `s = "ABCAABABCDAB"`
  - `w "ABCD"`

### Brute force solution

The brute force approach employs a straightforward method using two pointers: one traverses the main string `s` and the other checks against the target word `w`. For each character in `s`, it compares the subsequent characters up to the length of `w`. If a mismatch occurs, the pointer in `s` moves to the next character, and the comparison begins anew.

However, this approach has a time complexity of `O(mn)`, where `m = len(s)` and `n = len(w)`. This method can become extremely inefficient, especially when mismatches consistently occur near the end of` w` and when `w` itself appears late in `s`. For example, consider `s = "000000000000000000001"` and `w = "00000001"`. In this scenario, nearly every attempt will process almost the entire length of `w` before encountering a mismatch, leading to significant redundancy in the search process.

### The advantage of KMP

The **<ins>Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)</ins>** algorithm enhances efficiency through the use of a **<ins>Prefix Table</ins>** (aka. **<ins>"Partial Match" Table</ins>**[^wiki]) `next`. This table allows the algorithm to skip over sections of `s` that have previously been matched against parts of `w`, avoiding re-evaluation of characters that will anyway match according to the prefix table.
